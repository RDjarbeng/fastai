This repository contains sample code for my learning journey with fast ai.

Tried my own version of classifier by adding one more class instead of two as shown in fast ai lesson 1.

When I was doing this, the football Euro 2024 âš½was ongoing. Wanted to classify different players; Mbappe, Christiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
